Basic functionality:

1) Correct domain is already selected: IPD Problem (Novelty NEAT)
2) Press "Load Domain Default Parameters", then press "Create Random Population"
3) Start, to start the experiment.

- To view the current best genome, go to View > Best Genome for a diagram
- To view detailed information and progress on the current experiment, go to View > Problem Domain

Other options in the View panel are non-functional.

Please note that the program has not been thoroughly tested for edge-case scenarios, and that crashes and freezes could happen upon performing unexpected operations.

To change parameters as per Appendix B.2:

Change the Population Size in the main screen, on Page 1.
Change Evolution Specific (excluding the Activation Scheme) parameters on Page 2.
Change Genome Specific parameters on Page 2.
Change Domain Specific parameters in SharpNeatDomains.experiments.xml, lines 4 - 71 are relevant. Restart the program after saving changes in this xml file.
